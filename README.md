# ðŸŽ¯ jobbot3000

**jobbot3000** is a self-hosted, open-source job search copilot.
It was bootstrapped from
[futuroptimist/flywheel](https://github.com/futuroptimist/flywheel) and uses its
practices for linting, testing, and documentation.

## Getting Started

Requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) 20 or newer.

```bash
# Clone your fork
git clone git@github.com:YOURNAME/jobbot3000.git
cd jobbot3000

# Install dependencies (requires Node.js 20 or newer)
npm ci

# Run repo checks
npm run lint
npm run test:ci

# Summarize a job description
# Works with sentences ending in ., ?, or !
# Keep two sentences with --sentences, output plain text with --text
echo "First. Second. Third." | jobbot summarize - --sentences 2 --text
```

In code, import the `summarize` function and pass the number of sentences to keep:

```js
import { summarize } from './src/index.js';

const text = 'First sentence. Second sentence? Third!';
const summary = summarize(text, 2);
console.log(summary);
// "First sentence. Second sentence?"
```

Pass `0` to `summarize` to return an empty string.

Fetch remote job listings, normalize HTML to plain text, and log the result using an async helper:

```js
import { fetchTextFromUrl } from './src/fetch.js';

const run = async () => {
  const text = await fetchTextFromUrl('https://example.com', {
    timeoutMs: 5000,
    headers: { 'User-Agent': 'jobbot' }
  });
  console.log(text);
  // "<job description text>"
};

run();
```

`fetchTextFromUrl` strips scripts, styles, navigation, header, footer, aside,
and noscript content, preserves image alt text, and collapses whitespace to
single spaces. Pass `timeoutMs` (milliseconds) to override the 10s default,
and `headers` to send custom HTTP headers. Only `http` and `https` URLs are
supported; other protocols throw an error.

Normalize existing HTML without fetching and log the result:

```js
import { extractTextFromHtml } from './src/fetch.js';

const text = extractTextFromHtml('<p>Hello</p>');
console.log(text);
// "Hello"
```

Format parsed results as Markdown:

```js
import { toMarkdownSummary } from './src/exporters.js';

const md = toMarkdownSummary({
  title: 'Engineer',
  company: 'ACME',
  location: 'Remote',
  url: 'https://example.com/job',
  summary: 'Short blurb.',
  requirements: ['3+ years JS'],
});

console.log(md);
// # Engineer
// **Company**: ACME
// **Location**: Remote
// **URL**: https://example.com/job
//
// ## Summary
//
// Short blurb.
//
// ## Requirements
// - 3+ years JS
```

Pass `url` to include a source link in the rendered Markdown output.
`toMarkdownMatch` accepts the same `url` field to link match reports back to the job posting.
If `summary` is omitted, the requirements section is still separated by a blank line.

Both exporters accept an optional `locale` field to translate labels.
The default locale is `'en'`; Spanish (`'es'`) is also supported.

Use `toMarkdownMatch` to format fit score results; it also accepts `url`:

```js
import { toMarkdownMatch } from './src/exporters.js';

const md = toMarkdownMatch({
  title: 'Engineer',
  url: 'https://example.com/job',
  score: 75,
  matched: ['JS'],
  missing: ['Rust'],
});

console.log(md);
// # Engineer
// **URL**: https://example.com/job
// **Fit Score**: 75%
//
// ## Matched
// - JS
//
// ## Missing
// - Rust
```

The summarizer extracts the first sentence, handling `.`, `!`, `?`, and consecutive terminal
punctuation like `?!`, including when followed by closing quotes or parentheses. Terminators apply
only when followed by whitespace or the end of text, so decimals like `1.99` remain intact.
It ignores bare newlines.  
It scans text character-by-character to avoid large intermediate arrays and regex performance
pitfalls, falling back to the trimmed input when no sentence punctuation is found.
Trailing quotes or parentheses are included when they immediately follow punctuation, and all
Unicode whitespace is treated as a sentence boundary.
If fewer complete sentences than requested exist, any remaining text is appended so no content
is lost. Parenthetical abbreviations like `(M.Sc.)` remain attached to their surrounding sentence.
Common honorifics such as `Mr.` and `Dr.` are recognized so summaries aren't cut mid-sentence.

Example: `summarize('"Hi!" Bye.')` returns `"Hi!"`.

Job requirements may appear under headers like `Requirements`, `Qualifications`,
`What you'll need`, or `Responsibilities` (used if no other requirement headers are present).
They may start with `-`, `+`, `*`, `â€¢`, `â€“` (en dash), `â€”` (em dash), or numeric markers like `1.`
or `(1)`; these markers are stripped when parsing job text, even when the first requirement follows
the header on the same line. Leading numbers without punctuation remain intact. Requirement headers
are located in a single pass to avoid re-scanning large job postings, and resume scoring tokenizes
via a manual scanner and caches tokens (up to 60k lines) to avoid repeated work. Requirement bullets
are scanned without regex or temporary arrays, improving large input performance. Blank
requirement entries are skipped so empty bullets don't affect scoring.

## Raspberry Pi console fonts

Pi images bake a default console font so `setfont -d` works out of the box.
The `pi-image.yml` build config copies a fallback font into
`/usr/share/consolefonts` when no default is present, letting you change the
font size immediately after logging in.

## Tracking Application Lifecycle

Application statuses such as `no_response`, `rejected`, and `next_round` are saved to
`data/applications.json`, a gitignored file. Set `JOBBOT_DATA_DIR` to change the directory.
These records power local Sankey diagrams so progress isn't lost between sessions.
Writes are serialized to avoid dropping entries when recording multiple applications at once.
If the file is missing it will be created, but other file errors or malformed JSON will throw.
