# ðŸŽ¯ jobbot3000

**jobbot3000** is a self-hosted, open-source job search copilot.
It was bootstrapped from
[futuroptimist/flywheel](https://github.com/futuroptimist/flywheel) and uses its
practices for linting, testing, and documentation.

## Getting Started

Requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) 20 or newer.

```bash
# Clone your fork
git clone git@github.com:YOURNAME/jobbot3000.git
cd jobbot3000

# Verify Node.js version (requires 20 or newer)
node --version

# Install dependencies
npm ci

# Run repo checks
npm run lint
npm run test:ci

# Summarize a job description
# Works with sentences ending in ., ?, or !
# Keep two sentences with --sentences, output plain text with --text
echo "First. Second. Third." | npx jobbot summarize - --sentences 2 --text
# => First. Second.
# Non-numeric --sentences values fall back to 1 sentence
```

# Continuous integration
GitHub Actions runs lint and test checks on each push and pull request. To keep builds fast and reliable,
in-progress runs for the same branch are canceled when new commits arrive.

In code, import the `summarize` function and pass the number of sentences to keep:

```js
import { summarize } from './src/index.js';

const text = 'First sentence. Second sentence? Third!';
const summary = summarize(text, 2);
console.log(summary);
// "First sentence. Second sentence?"
```

Pass `0` to `summarize` to return an empty string.

Requesting more sentences than exist returns the entire text.

The example below demonstrates this behavior:

```js
const all = summarize('Only one sentence.', 5);
console.log(all);
// "Only one sentence."
```

Fetch remote job listings, normalize HTML to plain text, and log the result using an async helper:

```js
import { fetchTextFromUrl } from './src/fetch.js';

const run = async () => {
  const text = await fetchTextFromUrl('https://example.com', {
    timeoutMs: 5000,
    headers: { 'User-Agent': 'jobbot' }
  });
  console.log(text);
  // "<job description text>"
};

run();
```

`fetchTextFromUrl` strips scripts, styles, navigation, header, footer, aside,
and noscript content, preserves image alt text or `aria-label` values (while
ignoring `aria-hidden` images or those with `role="presentation"`/`"none"`), and
collapses whitespace to single spaces. Pass `timeoutMs` (milliseconds) to
override the 10s default, and `headers` to send custom HTTP headers. Responses
over 1 MB are rejected; override with `maxBytes` to adjust. Only `http` and
`https` URLs are supported; other protocols throw an error.

Normalize existing HTML without fetching and log the result:

```js
import { extractTextFromHtml } from './src/fetch.js';

const text = extractTextFromHtml('<p>Hello</p>');
console.log(text);
// "Hello"
```

Load resume files and return plain text:

```js
import { loadResume } from './src/resume.js';

const run = async () => {
  const text = await loadResume('resume.mdx');
  console.log(text);
  // "Plain text resume"
};

run();
```

`loadResume` supports `.pdf`, `.md`, `.markdown`, and `.mdx` files; other
extensions are read as plain text.

Format parsed results as Markdown. The exporters escape Markdown control characters so job
content cannot inject arbitrary links or formatting when rendered downstream:

```js
import { toMarkdownSummary } from './src/exporters.js';

const md = toMarkdownSummary({
  title: 'Engineer',
  company: 'ACME',
  location: 'Remote',
  url: 'https://example.com/job',
  summary: 'Short blurb.',
  requirements: ['3+ years JS'],
});

console.log(md);
// # Engineer
// **Company**: ACME
// **Location**: Remote
// **URL**: https://example.com/job
//
// ## Summary
//
// Short blurb.
//
// ## Requirements
// - 3+ years JS
```

Pass `url` to include a source link in the rendered Markdown output.
`toMarkdownMatch` accepts the same `url` field to link match reports back to the job posting.
If `summary` is omitted, the requirements section is still separated by a blank line.

Both exporters accept an optional `locale` field to translate labels.
The default locale is `'en'`; Spanish (`'es'`) is also supported.

Use `toMarkdownMatch` to format fit score results; it also accepts `url`:

```js
import { toMarkdownMatch } from './src/exporters.js';

const md = toMarkdownMatch({
  title: 'Engineer',
  url: 'https://example.com/job',
  score: 75,
  matched: ['JS'],
  missing: ['Rust'],
});

console.log(md);
// # Engineer
// **URL**: https://example.com/job
// **Fit Score**: 75%
//
// ## Matched
// - JS
//
// ## Missing
// - Rust
```

The summarizer extracts the first sentence, handling `.`, `!`, `?`, and consecutive terminal
punctuation like `?!`, including when followed by closing quotes or parentheses. Terminators apply
only when followed by whitespace or the end of text, so decimals like `1.99` remain intact.
Multi-level domains and email addresses stay intact even when they mix upper and lowercase
segments or are followed by a path (for example, `Careers.Acme.Co/jobs`).
It ignores bare newlines.  
It scans text character-by-character to avoid large intermediate arrays and regex performance
pitfalls, falling back to the trimmed input when no sentence punctuation is found.
Trailing quotes or parentheses are included when they immediately follow punctuation, and all
Unicode whitespace is treated as a sentence boundary.
If fewer complete sentences than requested exist, any remaining text is appended so no content
is lost. Parenthetical abbreviations like `(M.Sc.)` remain attached to their surrounding sentence.
Common honorifics such as `Mr.` and `Dr.` are recognized so summaries aren't cut mid-sentence.

Example: `summarize('"Hi!" Bye.')` returns `"Hi!"`.

Job titles can be parsed from lines starting with `Title`, `Job Title`, `Position`, or `Role`.
Headers can use colons or dash separators (for example, `Role - Staff Engineer`), and the same
separators work for `Company` and `Location`. Parser unit tests cover both colon and dash cases so
this behavior stays locked in.

Job requirements may appear under headers like `Requirements`, `Qualifications`,
`What you'll need`, or `Responsibilities` (used if no other requirement headers are present).
They may start with `-`, `+`, `*`, `â€¢`, `â€“` (en dash), `â€”` (em dash), alphabetical markers like `a.`
or `(a)`, or numeric markers like `1.` or `(1)`; these markers are stripped when parsing job text,
even when the first requirement follows
the header on the same line. Leading numbers without punctuation remain intact. Requirement headers
are located in a single pass to avoid re-scanning large job postings, and resume scoring tokenizes
via a manual scanner and caches tokens (up to 60k lines) to avoid repeated work. Automated tests
exercise this path with 120k-line resumes to ensure the tokenizer stays under 200ms. Requirement bullets
are scanned without regex or temporary arrays, improving large input performance. Blank or
non-string requirement entries are skipped so invalid bullets don't affect scoring.

## Raspberry Pi console fonts

Pi images bake a default console font so `setfont -d` works out of the box.
The Pi image build config copies a fallback font into
`/usr/share/consolefonts` when no default is present, letting you change the
font size immediately after logging in.

## Tracking Application Lifecycle

Application statuses such as `no_response`, `screening`, `onsite`, `offer`, `rejected`, and
`withdrawn` are saved to `data/applications.json`, a git-ignored file. Legacy entries using
`next_round` still load for backward compatibility. Set `JOBBOT_DATA_DIR` to change the directory.
These records power local Sankey diagrams so progress isn't lost between sessions.
Writes are serialized to avoid dropping entries when recording multiple applications at once.
If the file is missing it will be created, but other file errors or malformed JSON will throw.
Unit tests cover each status, concurrent writes, missing files, invalid JSON, and rejection of
unknown values.
