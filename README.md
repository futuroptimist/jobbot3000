# ðŸŽ¯ jobbot3000

**jobbot3000** is a self-hosted, open-source job search copilot.
It was bootstrapped from
[futuroptimist/flywheel](https://github.com/futuroptimist/flywheel) and uses its
practices for linting, testing, and documentation.

## Getting Started

Requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) 20 or newer.

```bash
# Clone your fork
git clone git@github.com:YOURNAME/jobbot3000.git
cd jobbot3000

# Install dependencies (requires Node.js 20)
npm ci

# Run repo checks
npm run lint
npm run test:ci

# Summarize a job description
# Works with sentences ending in ., ?, or !
echo "First sentence? Second sentence." | npm run summarize

# In code, pass the number of sentences to keep
# summarize(text, 2) returns the first two sentences
```

The summarizer extracts the first sentence, handling `.`, `!`, and `?` punctuation, and ignores bare newlines.

Job requirements may start with `-`, `*`, `â€¢`, `â€“` (en dash), or `â€”` (em dash),
and may appear on the same line as the requirements header; these markers are
stripped when parsing job text.
