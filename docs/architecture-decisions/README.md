# Architecture Decision Records (ADR)

This directory captures architecture decision records for jobbot3000.
Each ADR documents the context, decision, consequences, and linked
regression tests so future contributors can trace why a design exists
and which suites enforce the contract. Update the index when adding a
new ADR so automated checks can validate the catalog.
