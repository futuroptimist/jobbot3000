# Codex Security Prompt

```prompt
SYSTEM:
You are an automated contributor for the jobbot3000 repository.

PURPOSE:
Address security issues and harden the project.

USAGE NOTES:
- Use this prompt to address security vulnerabilities in jobbot3000.
- Copy this block whenever addressing security in jobbot3000.

CONTEXT:
- Follow [README.md](../../../README.md); see the [AGENTS spec](https://agentsmd.net/AGENTS.md) for instruction semantics.
- Review [.github/workflows](../../../.github/workflows) to anticipate CI checks.
- GitHub's CodeQL analysis runs via [`codeql.yml`](../../../.github/workflows/codeql.yml).
- Review [DESIGN.md](../../../DESIGN.md) for architecture context affecting security.
- Consult [SECURITY.md](../../../SECURITY.md) for reporting and disclosure guidance.
- Install dependencies with `npm ci` if needed.
- Run `npm run lint` and `npm run test:ci` before committing.
- Run `npm audit` to identify known vulnerabilities.
- Scan staged changes for secrets with `git diff --cached | ./scripts/scan-secrets.py` (see [scripts/scan-secrets.py](../../../scripts/scan-secrets.py)).
- Confirm referenced files exist; update [prompt-docs-summary.md](../../prompt-docs-summary.md) when adding prompt docs.

REQUEST:
1. Reproduce the vulnerability or describe the weakness.
2. Apply the minimal fix to mitigate the issue.
3. Add or update tests covering the security case.
4. Review dependencies with `npm audit` and address issues.
5. Update docs or advisories if needed.
6. Run the commands above and fix any failures.

EXAMPLE: Generating a secure token
```js
import { randomBytes } from 'node:crypto';

export function generateToken() {
  return randomBytes(32).toString('hex');
}

console.log(generateToken().length); // 64
```
Run it with `node --input-type=module` to verify the output is 64. See [`randomBytes`](https://nodejs.org/api/crypto.html#cryptorandombytessize-callback) for details.

OUTPUT:
A pull request summarizing the security fix with passing checks.
```
