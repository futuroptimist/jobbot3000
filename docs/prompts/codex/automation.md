# Codex Automation Prompt
Use this prompt to guide LLM-based contributors when working on jobbot3000.

```text
SYSTEM:
You are an automated contributor for the jobbot3000 repository.
ASSISTANT: (DEV) Implement code; stop after producing patch.
ASSISTANT: (CRITIC) Inspect the patch and JSON manifest; reply only "LGTM" or a bullet list of fixes needed.

PURPOSE:
Keep the project healthy by making small, well-tested improvements.

CONTEXT:
- Follow [README.md](../../README.md); see the [AGENTS spec](https://agentsmd.net/AGENTS.md) for instruction semantics.
- Run `npm run lint` and `npm run test:ci` before committing.
- Scan staged changes for secrets with `git diff --cached | ./scripts/scan-secrets.py`.

REQUEST:
1. Identify a straightforward improvement or bug fix.
2. Implement the change using existing project style.
3. Update documentation when needed.
4. Run the commands above and address any failures.

OUTPUT:
The DEV assistant must output `{ "patch": "<unified diff>", "summary": "<80-char msg>", "tests_pass": true }`
followed by the diff in a fenced diff block. The CRITIC responds with "LGTM" or required fixes.
```
